"""Blackboard — distributed multi-agent system; agents self-elect based on shared state.

The Blackboard pattern (classical AI, 1980s — HEARSAY-II speech-recognition system)
is a multi-agent architecture **without** a central supervisor. Instead, all agents
read a shared *blackboard* (the global state), and each round every agent decides
for itself whether it has something valuable to contribute given the current state.
The most confident bidder wins and writes to the blackboard. Repeat until no agent
wants to contribute (or budget runs out).

Compared to Multi-Agent (notebook 05) — which has a central Supervisor that *picks*
the next agent — Blackboard is fully decentralised: agents *self-elect*. This is
useful when:
  - You don't know in advance which expert will be relevant at each step.
  - The team composition is dynamic (agents can join / leave mid-run).
  - Opportunistic, exploratory tasks where the "right" next move isn't obvious.

Cost: each round costs N+1 LLM calls (N bids + 1 act) — Blackboard is more
expensive than Multi-Agent but more flexible.

Origin: HEARSAY-II (Erman et al., 1980), classical AI Blackboard architecture.
