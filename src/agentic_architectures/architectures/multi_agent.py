"""Multi-Agent Systems — a supervisor routes work to role-specialised agents.

A team of agents, each with its own role (system prompt) and tools, collaborates
to solve a problem too broad for any one of them. A **supervisor** agent reads
the conversation history and routes to the next specialist — or to a final
*Writer* that synthesises all specialists' outputs.

Why a team beats one big agent:
  - **Focused context** per specialist (their system prompt narrows the search space).
  - **Division of labour** lets you mix tools — the Financial agent has access to
    a stock-quote tool, the News agent has web search, the Code agent has a REPL.
  - **Inspectability** — each specialist's output is a separately-labelled artifact
    in the trace, much easier to debug than one giant monologue.

The supervisor is the *coordination protocol*. Variations:
  - **Manager-style supervisor** (this notebook): a router that picks `next`
    from a fixed roster, plus a Writer node.
  - **Hierarchical**: supervisors-of-supervisors, used for very large teams.
  - **Blackboard** (notebook 07): no central supervisor; agents subscribe to
    shared state and self-elect.

Origin: long history in classical MAS; modern LLM versions trace to AutoGen
(Microsoft, 2023), CrewAI (2023), and LangGraph's supervisor pattern.
