"""ReAct — Reason + Act in alternation, with Thought architecturally guaranteed.

Naive implementations of ReAct on modern tool-calling APIs (including
`langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent`) place both the Thought and the
Action into a single AIMessage — the Thought in `content`, the Action in
`tool_calls`. The problem: many models (Llama 3.x, smaller OSS models)
happily emit a tool call with empty `content`, which silently degrades
ReAct into plain Tool Use (see notebook 02).

This implementation **guarantees** a Thought before every Action by
splitting the loop into two explicit nodes:

  - `think` runs the LLM **without** tools and asks for ONLY a Thought.
  - `act` runs the LLM **with** tools and chooses one tool call or the
    final answer.

Cost: 2 LLM calls per ReAct round instead of 1, but the Thought channel
cannot be skipped by the model.
